# CPE 140 - Fall 2019 - Assignment 8
## Submission
### Task 1: Visualize simple continuous signals
#### Part 1: Workstation Function Generator
For this part of the assignment we connected the oscilloscope to the workstation's built in function generator. From here we changed the type of function being generated to see what it looked like on the oscilloscope.

#### Part 2: Rigol Function Generator
For this part of the assignment we connected to oscilloscope to the rigol function generator in order to see what the it looked like on the oscilloscope.

#### Part 3: Pulse Width Generator Test
For this part of the assignment we wrote a simple program that took advantage of the servo.setpulse command on the microbit and used the oscilloscope to show what the command did.

#### Part 4: Varying Duty Cycle
For this part of the assignment we figured out that the period of the PWM generated by the command was about 20000 microseconds so we used some math to find out that it would take 1000 microseconds to increment 5% duty cycles. In the code this can be seen with the setpulse being written with 1000 microseconds times some multiplier, up to 95% duty which allows for the change between 5% to 95% duty in 5% increments. With switch statments we kept the duty cycles within 5% to 95% and the a button increases the duty while the b button decreases the duty.

#### Part 5: Miscellaneous Servo Functions
For this part of the assignment we were tasked to find out what the other servo function did so we used the servoWritepin function and found out that the function would be used mainly for something like a robot arm. When varying the angle of the function we saw that it only went up to a certain duty cycle on the oscilloscope and this max duty cycle was accompanied by the 180 degree angle. Along with this the lowest duty cycle was zero which would signify the robot arm being fully folded and 180 degrees being the arm fully stretched out. Any farther than 180 or higher than the max duty cycle would result in a broken robot arm.
